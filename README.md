# Gina AI Factory — v1.18.2

## Phase 36 follow-up — Create Studio completion finalisation

Create Studio now reconciles active ComfyUI jobs against authoritative `/history` when a WebSocket completion event is missed. A generation that reaches 25/25 and 100% can therefore transition through final output retrieval to COMPLETED without a browser refresh.

## Phase 34 + Phase 36 — Qwen/Gemma routing, generation telemetry & persistent edit queue

- **Qwen 2.5-VL 7B + mmproj-F16** is now an explicit Local AI engine choice and deterministically routes image creation/reference editing to **Juggernaut-XL v9**.
- **Gemma 3 12B Q4_K_M** routes image creation/reference editing to **FLUX.1-Schnell GGUF Q4_K_S**.
- Added the missing **Juggernaut-XL reference-edit workflow** so Qwen vision edits no longer fall back to FLUX.
- Generation jobs now record and display the exact LLM, vision projector, image model and workflow used while a job is running.
- Added `docs/EDIT_REQUESTS.md` as the persistent human-to-agent edit queue.
- Phase 34 is implementation-complete; live Windows/ComfyUI acceptance should verify the Qwen vision → Juggernaut reference-edit path end-to-end.

## v1.17.27 System UI reorganization

The System workspace is now organized into focused tabs: Overview, Hardware, Models & Workflows, Safeguards, and Logs. The Logs tab contains the copy-ready Dashboard Error Log and telemetry console.

## v1.17.25 upload stability fix

Local attachment/reference-image uploads no longer trigger Vite HMR reloads. The local `local_ai_uploads` store is ignored by the development file watcher, preventing in-flight upload requests from being aborted with `BadRequestError: request aborted`.

# Gina local ComfyUI workflows

Drop **ComfyUI API-format workflow JSON** files into this folder.

Use ComfyUI's `Save (API Format)` / API export, not the normal UI graph JSON.

Gina scans these files at startup and exposes the discovered capabilities and parameter bindings through its local API.


## v1.17.22 attachment/vision fixes

- Create Studio now always exposes the local reference-image uploader. A bundled `flux_image_reference` API workflow is included; when the selected workflow has no `LoadImage` input, Gina offers a one-click switch to the reference workflow.
- Local AI attachments now send uploaded images to the backend as actual multimodal `image_url` inputs when a llama.cpp `mmproj` is available.
- Gina auto-detects `*mmproj*.gguf` beside the Gemma model, or accepts `GINA_LLM_MMPROJ` explicitly.
- Local AI shows `VISION READY` vs `TEXT ONLY` so an upload is never mistaken for visual understanding.
- `Start_Local_LLM.bat` also auto-detects the projector.


## Diagnostics/HMR safety (v1.17.27)
The dashboard error-log endpoint is intentionally failure-proof. Vite HMR is opt-in via `GINA_HMR=true`; this prevents local metadata/runtime changes from reloading the page while an attachment upload is in flight.


### AIDA64 1024×600 protection
AIDA64 generation is hard-locked to 1024×600 at workflow submission and output validation. The 12-gauge background mode masks AI-generated instrumentation inside the live Gauge Factory zones before the real 100-state gauges are overlaid.
