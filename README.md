## v1.17.27 System UI reorganization

The System workspace is now organized into focused tabs: Overview, Hardware, Models & Workflows, Safeguards, and Logs. The Logs tab contains the copy-ready Dashboard Error Log and telemetry console.

## v1.17.25 upload stability fix

Local attachment/reference-image uploads no longer trigger Vite HMR reloads. The local `local_ai_uploads` store is ignored by the development file watcher, preventing in-flight upload requests from being aborted with `BadRequestError: request aborted`.

# Gina local ComfyUI workflows

Drop **ComfyUI API-format workflow JSON** files into this folder.

Use ComfyUI's `Save (API Format)` / API export, not the normal UI graph JSON.

Gina scans these files at startup and exposes the discovered capabilities and parameter bindings through its local API.


## v1.17.22 attachment/vision fixes

- Create Studio now always exposes the local reference-image uploader. A bundled `flux_image_reference` API workflow is included; when the selected workflow has no `LoadImage` input, Gina offers a one-click switch to the reference workflow.
- Local AI attachments now send uploaded images to the backend as actual multimodal `image_url` inputs when a llama.cpp `mmproj` is available.
- Gina auto-detects `*mmproj*.gguf` beside the Gemma model, or accepts `GINA_LLM_MMPROJ` explicitly.
- Local AI shows `VISION READY` vs `TEXT ONLY` so an upload is never mistaken for visual understanding.
- `Start_Local_LLM.bat` also auto-detects the projector.


## Diagnostics/HMR safety (v1.17.27)
The dashboard error-log endpoint is intentionally failure-proof. Vite HMR is opt-in via `GINA_HMR=true`; this prevents local metadata/runtime changes from reloading the page while an attachment upload is in flight.


### AIDA64 1024×600 protection
AIDA64 generation is hard-locked to 1024×600 at workflow submission and output validation. The 12-gauge background mode masks AI-generated instrumentation inside the live Gauge Factory zones before the real 100-state gauges are overlaid.
